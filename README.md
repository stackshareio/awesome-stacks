> Awesome tech stacks for all kinds of applications, inspired by [awesome.re](http://awesome.re).

Awesome Stacks is a community-curated list of tech stacks for building different applications and features. It is open source and inspired by the original [awesome list](http://awesome.re/).

Each stack in the list has a name, description, and list of a few of the key tools and technologies. Optionally, it links to a tutorial, starter kit or boilerplate that makes it easy to get started with.

Got a stack you think is a great way to build something? Please edit this file and add it! Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

### Browsing the stacks

Stacks can be browsed in two places—on the README and on [awesomestacks.dev](https://awesomestacks.dev/). The site, built with Gatsby and React, displays logos and metrics about each tool listed in the README by pulling data from the GitHub and StackShare APIs.
