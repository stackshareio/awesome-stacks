Awesome Stacks is a community-curated list of tech stacks for building different applications and features. It is open source and inspired by the original [awesome list](http://awesome.re/).

Each stack in the list has a name, description, and list of a few of the key tools and technologies. Optionally, it links to a tutorial, starter kit or boilerplate that makes it easy to get started with.

Got a stack you think is the best way to do something? Please edit this file and add it! Check out <a href="https://github.com/stackshareio/awesome-stacks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> for more information.

### Where can I see the stacks?

Stacks can be browsed in two places—on the README and on [awesomestacks.dev](https://awesomestacks.dev/). The site, built with Gatsby and React, displays logos and metrics about each tool listed in the README by pulling data from the GitHub and StackShare APIs.

### Who writes the awesome stacks?

You do! Just like awesome lists, anyone is welcome and encouraged to contribute their knowledge. See the [Contribution Guide](/docs) for how to get started.

### Who’s behind all this?

Awesome Stacks is built and maintained by [StackShare](https://https://stackshare.io/) with the help of [DeveloperMode](https://developermode.com/). StackShare’s mission is to help developers discover new tools and make better technology decisions, and generally to make building software more awesome ✌️
