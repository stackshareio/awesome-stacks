# Introduction

Need a site search? If you have content that you want users to find, the answer is yes! Thankfully it's not hard to add a basic site search using Algolia, even if your content doesn't live in a well-organized CMS or database. This awesome stack is a collection of all of the various tools you'll need to crawl and scrape your site's content, upload it to Algolia, then add a search box to your UI.

# Search Engine

<Tools>
  <StackShare name="Serverless">
    Algolia's Community plan is free up to 10,000 records with unlimited search queries.

    Crawls the sitemap and uses CSS selectors to extract elements from the page, then pushes the data to a configured Algolia index. Written in Node.js. 
  </GitHub>
</Tools>
